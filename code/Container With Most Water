Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.


public class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int most=0;
        int vol=0;
        int len=height.length;
        int left=0;
        int right=len-1;
        while(left<right){
            vol=(right-left)*Math.min(height[left],height[right]);
            most=(most>=vol)?most:vol;
            if(height[left]<height[right]){
                left++;
            }else{
                right--;
            }
        }
        return most;
    }
}
